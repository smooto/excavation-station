# Excavation Station

_A browser-based archaeology game built in React_

## Concept

Excavation Station is a Minesweeper-like game in which players collect fossils and other artifacts, discovering more about the narrative world as they play.

## Inspiration

Excavation Station's core digging mechanic is modeled directly after the mobile game [TAP! DIG! MY MUSEUM!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.oridio.museum&hl=en_US) and the fossil-digging and mining minigames in [Parkasaurus](https://www.parkasaurusgame.com/) and Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum.
